Protostar Heap2:

Stupid free exploit

Use auth to allocate some memory for auth's structure
	"auth Stolen"
Then free so that malloc can allocate again at that position on that memory page
	"reset"
Use service to allocate again, near to old auth's structure allocation and overflow it
	"service Stealing Protostar Sucks"
Then just call login
	"login"

Easy, fast, stupid, protostar.
